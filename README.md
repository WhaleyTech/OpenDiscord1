# First Time Setup

It is recommended to setup the repository with a Python virtual environment. Documentation on creation of a virtual environment [is here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html?).

``` 
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Rename *config.example.json* to *config.json* and fill in the rest.

```json
{
    "prefix": "PREFIX HERE",
    "token": "TOKEN HERE",
    "name": "NAME HERE"
}
```
